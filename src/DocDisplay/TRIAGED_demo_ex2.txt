Russian president vladimir putin said that russia may opt back into the conventional forces in europe (CFE) if NATO members ratify and begin fulfilling the terms of the agreement. Putin signed a federal law on November 30, 2007 suspending Russia's obligations to the cfe treaty. The suspension of the CFE treaty meant that Russia would temporarily stop providing information, receiving international inspectors and allowing inspections russia will not be bound during this period by any commitment to conventional armaments.Russia had threatened several times to withdraw from the CFE amid tensions with the united states over us plans to install a missile defense shield in eastern Europe.
